# DNA-SEQUENCING
<p>DNA sequencing is the process of determining the precise order of nucleotides—adenine
(A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C)—within a DNA molecule. It serves as the
foundation for understanding genetic information, enabling advances in fields like
medicine, agriculture, and evolutionary biology. From a biological perspective, sequencing
unravels the molecular instructions that govern the development, function, and heredity of
living organisms.
In the realm of Discrete Mathematical Structures (DMS), concepts like permutations,
combinations, and graph theory are essential tools for analysing and interpreting DNA
sequences. Permutations aid in generating all possible sequences of nucleotides, crucial for
understanding variations and mutations. Permutation is the distinct interpretations of a
provided number of components carried one by one, or some, or all at a time. For example,
if we have two components A and B, then there are two likely performances, AB and BA.
Combinatorial techniques assist in identifying subsequence within larger genetic datasets,
and graph theory helps model complex relationships between genes and proteins.
By combining the precision of biology with the computational power of discrete
mathematics, DNA sequencing enables the study of genetic data at an unprecedented scale,
unlocking insights into life processes and offering solutions to pressing challenges in health
and sustainability. This synergy underscores the multidisciplinary essence of modern
science and its impact on society</p>
